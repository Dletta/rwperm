    To have abstract application keys into a keychain, so you can keep

    shift your logins between applications or shared documents

    We do this by:

    - Initiate 2 instances of gun.
    - The main user instance will act as you, using a key chain to keep key pairs
      that apps may generate.
    - All keys will be encrypted to yourself, which means only you will be able to access
      them.
    - Other users may come and look at your profile via alias search or public key,
      but they will only be able to read, what you have encrypted to them specifically.

    shared private lists and public lists (public as in unencrypted, discoverable)

    Essentially the idea of the appInterface is that you log into the app whenever
    you want to write or read from a private list. (Shared or not)

    This happens in the background for the user, so he won't know that we are switching
